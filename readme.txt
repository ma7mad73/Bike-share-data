Overview:

In this project, you will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
It will import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
It also has a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Bike Share Data:

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. 
Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, we will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
we will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The Datasets:

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

Statistics Computed:

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. 
In this project, our code will provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip:
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration:
total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info:
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
